# Scripts and Documentation for the purpoused pipeline

Before you use the scripts available here, we strong recommend that you read the documentation of each script for proper use.
In addition to that, you should also make sure that you install the required python libraries (those are in the "requirements.txt" file), and that you have installed the ISIS software, with the base kernels and Dawn mission ISIS data (https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3).

## Scripts

In the Scripts directory you will find all the three scripts described in the report, which compose the entire pipeline.

## Documentation
